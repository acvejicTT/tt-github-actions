# Tensorrent GitHub Actions

This repository contains a collection of GitHub Actions that can be shared across the Tensorrent project. Each action is in a separate folder, and there is basic infrastructure to run tests for a particular action if the code in its folder has changed. Additionally, there are workflows to showcase action usage.
